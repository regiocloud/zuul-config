      The recommended base job.

      All jobs ultimately inherit from this.  It runs a pre-playbook
      which copies all of the job's prepared git repos on to all of
      the nodes in the nodeset.

      It also sets a default timeout value (which may be overidden).
    pre-run: playbooks/base/pre.yaml
    post-run:
      - playbooks/base/post.yaml
      - playbooks/base/post-logs.yaml
    roles:
      - zuul: zuul/zuul-jobs
    timeout: 1800
    nodeset: ubuntu-jammy

- job:
    name: base-extra-logs
    parent: base
    description: |
      A base job variant with extra logs.

      In addition to the plain base job this collects extra logs,
      docs and artifacts from all nodes.
    post-run:
      - playbooks/base/post-fetch.yaml
